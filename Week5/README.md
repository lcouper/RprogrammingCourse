# Week 5: Independent Project #

We've made it to the fun part! So far, we've covered:

- the layout and functionality of R studio
- importing data
- install packages
- subsetting, reshaping, and manipulating data
- conducting basic statistics
- creating data visualizations
- for loops
- if/else statements
- writing functions

Now it's time to put it all together! Find a data set that *piques your interest*. 
This could be data that you have collected from a personal/research projet or one that you've found online. 
If you are struggling to find one, there are some free datasets available here:
https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/00Index.html
and here:
https://www.ecarleton.ca/mod/folder/view.php?id=641

Using one of these datasets, import it into R and try analyzing it! This could involve looking for trends between different variables,
creating basic plots to summarize the data, reshaping the data and performing basic calculations on it to make it easier for others to work with.
The world is your oyster!

The goal is simply to:
1) find and analyze data that interests you
2) produce some type of analysis of plot that you could describe to someone else
