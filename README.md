# Welcome to Statistical Programming for Biology: Introduction to R  ! #

## Objectives ##

By the end of the course, students will feel confident using R for basic data analysis and visualization. Namely, students will be able to: manipulate data sets, find and install packages, conduct preliminary statistical analyses, and create basic visualizations.

## Prerequisites ##

No prior programming experience is required or expected. There are no prerequisities.

## Format ##
This is a 2-unit, independent study course. In-person instruction (2 hours / per week) will consist of a short content introduction, followed by individual/group work on exercises in R using biological data sets. Exercises will be completed outside of class time and are expected to take an additional 2 hours/week. Exercises are intended to be challenging and to extend beyond what is introduced in class. To complete the exercise, students are encouraged to use any and all resources including consulting each other, online help pages (e.g., stackoverflow, r-bloggers, etc.) and the instrutor. 

## Evaluations ## 

There are no weekly homework assignments or exams. I encourage you to submit your practice exercises to me for feedback, but this is not required and these will not be 'graded'. There are no formal evaluations. The one assignment for the course is to complete a small (either group or independent) project on the final week in which you practice some of the R concepts you learned on a biological dataset of your choosing. 

## Course Meetings ##

The course meets weekly on Wednesdays from 01:00 PM - 02:50 PM. We will typically meet in person in room 4602, but will meet virtually for the first week at the zoom link below:

## Schedule Overview ##

| Week | Topic | 
| :---- | :---- | 
| 1 (6/29) | Introduction to R and its use in biological research, Navigating R Studio , Importing data sets & basic summary stats | 
| 2 (7/6) | Data manipulation | 
| 3 (7/13) | Basic statistical analysis and plotting -- summary statistics, t.tests, chi-squared, ggplot | 
| 4 (7/20) | An intro to 'advanced' topics in R -- for loops, if/else statements, writing functions |
| 5 (7/27) | Group project on a biological dataset of your choosing |

## Course Philosophy ##

Growth mindset. Everyone has the ability to learn and improve their abilities through effort, support, and experience. The practice exercises are designed to be challenging and incorporate concepts and information not necessarily covered in the lecture notes. You are encouraged to use any means you can think of to complete these exercises -- the internet, each other, me, etc.
