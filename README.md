## Course Objectives ##

By the end of the course, students will have gained an understanding of how R can be used for data processing, analysis, and visualizaiton. Students will felt comfortable importing and manipulating data sets, finding and installing packages, conducting preliminary statistical analyses, and creating basic visualizations.

## Course Format ##
In-person instruction (2 hours / per week) consisting of a short content introduction, followed by individual/group work on exercises in R using biological data sets. Exercises will be completed outside of class time and are expected to take an additional 2 hours/week. There are no formal evaluations.
