# Welcome to Statistical Programming for Biology: Introduction to R  ! #

## Course Objectives ##

By the end of the course, students will feel confident using R for basic data analysis and visualization. Namely, students will be able to: manipulate data sets, find and install packages, conduct preliminary statistical analyses, and create basic visualizations.

## Course Format ##
In-person instruction (2 hours / per week) consisting of a short content introduction, followed by individual/group work on exercises in R using biological data sets. Exercises will be completed outside of class time and are expected to take an additional 2 hours/week. There are no formal evaluations. No prior programming experience is required or expected.
